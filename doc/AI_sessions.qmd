## Deliverables

### [Proposal](../paper/proposal/proposal_deliverable/proposal.qmd), [Data Sourcing](../src/data_sourcing.ipynb): [Link to chat]()

## Copilot - Agent mode, Claude Sonnet 4

### Pilot analysis:
- "I need you to - WITHOUT EDITING ANY FILE EXCEPT pilot.qmd - write appropriate pilot experiments using cobined_repository_data.json. Appropriateness should be defined by what you read in outline.qmd, proposal.qmd. data_sourcing.qmd contains what has already been done. Remember that the ONLY file you are allowed to edit is pilot.qmd!!!"
- "add a block at the beginning which installs rquired packages if not already existing in env"
