## File Structure/Disclaimer

I've decided to include a this as I enjoy clean file structures and .qmd rendering seems a bit messy. I will be including .qmd versions of the assignment outlines alongside the assignment writeups in dedicated folders so that - once rendered - the file structure is clean and easy to navigate.

The way I will structure the `paper` folder is as follows:
- `<assignment_name>/`: Contains the following:
  - `<assignment_name>_deliverable/`: Contains the **actual assignment writeup** in `.qmd` format.
  - `outline/`: Contains the assignment outline in `.qmd` format
